BugzillaClient
==============

This is a project I started for school in late 2011. It's been sitting on the shelf since 
then but I've had a few requests to make it available for public development. 

I was attampting to make a, largely, android independant java bugzilla json-rpc library within
the BaseClass that could be reused in other java projects, Android or otherwise. To what degree
I succeeded or failed I'm not sure. 

Please feel free to email me with question or comments and also let me know if you fork it, I'd
like to see what others think to do with the code.
